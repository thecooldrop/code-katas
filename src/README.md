This book will contain coding exercises and reference solutions
to practice wide range of coding skills in many programming languages
on a practical level.

The plan for the book is to eventually contain exercises which 
are language specific, such as implementing certain things
in certain frameworks, as well as exercises which can be implemented
in language chosen by the reader.

We will strive to provide reference solutions, but none are
guaranteed to be provided. Solutions are welcome.
